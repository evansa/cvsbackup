cvsbackup
=========

A little backup script for CVS repositories

To use this script:
  - Optionally, create a new user (I have a remotebackup user that does all my backups)
  - Install this script somewhere (I use ~remotebackup/bin)
  - Edit the script to suit your needs (you'll need to change $user and $projects)
  - Put this cript in your crontab to run once per day
